<title>My AWESOME new project in Blender! - COOL - Day01</title>

</head>
<body>
And that's the end. See a walkthrough here of the thing: https://d.tube/#!/v/flynneastwood/kovmbklhy8k

Game is broken, there is no item to bring back to the zombie so it is a neverending nightmare but If you want to try it out for yourself: https://flynneastwood.itch.io/failed-leapdaygamejamplatformer

After all, I've learned quite a lot and I'm already thrill to do another project in Godot! By the way , if you kinda want to get into making simple platformers or 2d style games, check out https://godotengine.org/ I've also used https://www.kenney.nl/ game art assets for free. They are amazing!

More life struggles to come.

Peace out!
